Metadata Formats
================================================================================

Using metadata files, information can be given about samples, reference
sequences, and sections.
All metadata files are in comma-separated values (CSV) format, which is
advantageous because it is both human-readable and widely supported by software
including Microsoft Excel and Python.
An example in CSV format is given for each type of metadata file.
